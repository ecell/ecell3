=== About ===

This is a sample model for Differential/Algebraic Equations of index-1,
represents the single pendulum problem.
This model consists five variables,
two differential equations and three algebraic equations.

Variables shows the coodinate (X, Y), the velocity (U, V) and
the tension T of a string.

=== Running this model ===

1. (If necessary) Convert the .em file to .eml file.

   % ecell3-em2eml Pendulum.em
   % ls Pendulum.eml
   DAE.eml


2. Compile .cpp files

   % ecell3-dmc *.cpp
   % ls *.so
   Algebraic1Process.so  Algebraic3Process.so     Differential2Process.so
   Algebraic2Process.so  Differential1Process.so

3. Run the model.

   GUI mode:
       gecell, File->loadModel and load the Pendulum.eml file.

   Script mode: (a script ess file is still not prepared)
       ecell3-session -f Pendulum.eml
