=== About ===

This is a toy model of the Hybrid Dynamic/Static Simulation Method,
to be run on E-Cell Simulation Environment Version 3.

=== Usage ===

When you use Hybrid Dynamic/Static Simulation Method in your model,
you need FluxDistributionStepper.

* FluxDistributionStepper

When you use FluxDistributionStepper,
FluxDistributionStepper does not need to set Properties.

Processes in static part set this Stepper's StepperID. 

FluxDistributionStepper do not have StepInterval,
call interupt() at interupt by Other Stepper, do not call step() by self,
and compute fluxes of processes in static part.
