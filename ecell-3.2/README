About the code names
--------------------
Hekkoro
    Code name for E-Cell SE Version 3 (libecs, libemc and pyecs)
Koyurugi
    Code name for the libecs class library
Osogo
    Code name for the GUI Session monitor (gecell)

Documentation
=============
E-Cell 3 users manual is placed under ``{PREFIX}/share/doc/users-manual``.

If you have doxygen, API reference will be built and installed in
``{PREFIX}/share/doc/api`` .

Basic Usage
===========

1. Using E-Cell from python interpreter
---------------------------------------
By default a python binding (pyecs) is built.

To invoke a E-Cell Session Script interpreter in interactive mode, use ``ecell3-sesion`` script. Note that the script expects {PREFIX}/bin is included in PATH environment, where {PREFIX} is the directory path that was specified to configure. 
(If you have not specified it, it falls back to ``/usr/local``.)

A typical command-line session is as follows::

   $ ecell3-session
   ecell3-session [ E-Cell SE Version 3.1.106, on Python Version 2.3.4 ]
   Copyright (C) 1996-2009 Keio University.
   Send feedback to Koichi Takahashi <shafi@e-cell.org>
   ecell3-session>>>

In the above output, ``ecell3-session>>>`` is the prompt of ecell3-session. That accepts almost everything of interactive Python.

The below example first loads a model that is stored in simple.eml, and then run it for 10 seconds in simulation time::

   ecell3-session>>> loadModel( 'simple.eml' )
   <simple.eml, t=0>>> run( 10 )
   <simple.eml, t=10.001>>>

2. Using E-Cell from Session Monitor GUI
----------------------------------------
If you have python, and pygtk2 installed, a GUI session monitor, is built.

To use Session Monitor, type::

   $ ecell3-session-monitor

Sample Models
=============

Sample models are installed under {PREFIX}/share/doc/samples.  Each model is
stored as a EM script, while ecell toolsuite only accept XML-based EML files.

EM scripts can be converted to EML files through the program ``ecell3-em2eml``::

   $ ecell3-em2eml Drosophila.em

This will create Drosophila.eml in the current working directory.

Some samples require that the accompanying dynamic modules (DM's) be
built before running simulation.  These modules are provided as C++ sources
which can be compiled using ``ecell3-dmc``::

   $ ecell3-dmc SomeModule.cpp

For more information about the dynamic module, refer to the users manual.
