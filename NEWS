ecell-3.1.108: 5-Feb-2010

 * Fixed model-editor to not create temporary files under the current directory.
   This change solves permission-related problems on Windows and boosts up
   the start-up speed as well.


ecell-3.1.108RC3: 27-Jan-2010

 * Fixed dmcompile so that it would choose the right compiler.

 * Fixed libltdl autoconf script in order to get it work with newer versions
   of libtool.

 * libtool_overrides.m4 that overrides several internal functions of the
   libtool autoconf script to support Fujitsu C++ compiler.


ecell-3.1.108RC2: 15-Jan-2010

 * Fixed ecell3-dmc so that it accepts -o (--output=) option so that users
   can specify extra object files to the command line as well.

 * Resuscitate ecell3-session-monitor which stopped working due to the
   migration to gtk.Builder.


ecell-3.1.108RC1: 13-Jan-2010

 * Refactored differential steppers so that they give accurate results on
   the step right after the (re)start.  A new virtual method
   DifferentialStepper::updateInternalState() was added to accomplish this,
   and therefore backwards binary compatibility was lost as for Steppers' DMs.

 * Unbundled ply as it's pretty obsolete.  Users must install it beforehand.

 * Switched to gtk.Builder from gtk.glade.XML.


ecell-3.1.107: 4-Jul-2009

 * Added new API functions, libecs::issueWarning() and
   libecs::setWarningHandler() that can be used to report a warning to the
   frontend from within a dynamic module.

 * Deprecated Stepper's "MaxStepInterval" property as it doesn't make much
   sense.

 * Added a new property "TolerableRejectedStepCount" to DifferentialStepper
   (i.e. ODEStepper and its siblings) that specifies the maximum torelable
   count of rejected steps.

 * Fixed a bug in ODEStepper that causes SIGABRT under the circumstances
   no processes are associated to the stepper. Noticed by Sachio Nohara.
   Thanks.

 * Patched libltdl so it would not be interfered by the newer versions of
   libtool.

 * Migrated to libsbml 3.x.  SBML to EML and EML to SBML converter are now
   officially confirmed to work with it.

 * Changed ecell3-session-monitor so that it would never change the current
   working directory to the one the model file is located.
   Patch by Michele Mattioni.  Thanks.

 * Console class in the ecell3-session-manager script insensibly imports
   the attributes of a SessionManager instance into the global scope, which
   turned out to obstruct the definition of classes in the user script.
   Noticed by Giuseppe Aprea.  Thanks.


ecell-3.1.107RC4: 5-Apr-2009

 * Resource files required by the frontends (session monitor and model editor)
   were completely missing in the tarballs due to the errors in Makefile.
   Noticed by 김한조.  Thanks.

 * Console class in the ecell3-session-manager script insensibly imports
   the attributes of a SessionManager instance into the global scope, which
   turned out to obstruct the definition of classes in the user script.
   Noticed by Giuseppe Aprea.  Thanks.


ecell-3.1.107RC3: 11-Mar-2009

 * Removed deprecate API calls in session-monitor. This enables it to run
   on Mac OS X with the native GTK+.

 * Fixed bugs in DM compiler tools.

 * Fixed weird behavior of the expression compiler that is used in
   Expression*Process'es.

 * Eliminate usage of string module.

 * Fixed win32 build.


ecell-3.1.107RC2: 6-Feb-2009

 * Fixed a bug in ecell.Session.saveLoggerData().

 * Fixed a bug in ecell.ECDDataFile.


ecell-3.1.107RC1: 5-Feb-2009

 * Fixed compilation problem on newer GCC (>= 4.3).

 * Reorganized the source tree structure.

   - Integrated pyecs into pyecell.

   - Merged ecell.emc into ecell.ecs to avoid static initializer weirdness in
     some platform (including Mac OS X).

   - Two GUI frontends (session-monitor and model-editor) were renewed to be
     two packages of python modules, ecell.ui.osogo and ecell.ui.model_editor.

 * pyecell changes

   - Moved GtkSessionMonitor to ecell.ui.osogo.GtkSessionMonitor that resides
     in ecell/frontend/session_manager

   - Renamed ecell.SessionManager to ecell.session_manager.

   - Removed the following constants from ecell.ecs_constants.

     - TRUE
     - FALSE


ecell-3.1.106: 5-Feb-2008

  * class PropertySlotProxyLoggerAdapter was decoupled from PropertySlot.hpp
    to the separate file, PropertySlotProxyLoggerAdapter.hpp in order not to
    incorporate various concerns in a single file.

  * A number of leaks were plugged. Note that a few other leaks involved in
    property interfaces are still active in this release on purpose to
    maintain binary compatibility with older releases. The fix was already
    established and will be in the next release.

  * Visual Studio build files (build/msvc/*.vcproj) were updated so it can
    cross-build 64-bit binaries.

  * PythonProcess and PythonFluxProcess now don't require that python
    interpreter be already initialized.

  * model-editor no longer depends on Python for Windows Extension.
    Now the win32 / win64 native builds require Python 2.4 or later.


ecell-3.1.106RC2: 24-Dec-2007

  * Avoided resetting LD_LIBRARY_PATH in ecell-python for the sake of
    inter-platform operability. This was also problematic in combination within
    multiple ldconfig paths.

  * Fixed sample installation rule so that samples would get installed in
    sample-per-directory manner.

  * Fixed configure scripts for dmtool and dynamic modules so that modules they
    produce would have right extensions that follows the libltdl's convention.


ecell-3.1.106RC1: 14-Dec-2007

  * Updated bundled libtool script for better compatibility with MacOSX and
    similar systems.

  * The users manual is now bundled in the distribution.

  * Improved dynamic priority queue.

  * Support for the newest NumPy release in ecell.Analysis.

  * Numerous minor bugfixes.

  * Added two new functions, libecs::initialize() and libecs::finalize().
    Those functions need to be called before using the simulation kernel or
    after finished up with it respectively. Users don't have to take care of
    this change as long as they are using E-Cell through the Python frontends
    as these functions are automatically called on start-up and clean-up
    of pyecs module.
