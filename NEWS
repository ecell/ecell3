ecell-3.2.1: 17-Jun-2010

 * Removed DifferentialStepper::initializeStepInterval() in favor of
   virtualized Stepper::setStepInterval().

 * Better compatibility with Fujitsu C++ compiler.

 * Fixed possible segmentation fault that occurs during loading a DM.

 * Removed funky macros derived from UtilLinux.

 * Optimized code in VariableReference.


ecell-3.2.0p2: 2-Apr-2010

 * Fixed DataPointVector's python wrapper to have "shape" property that returns
   the shape of the array.  That is required by TableIO module.
   (notified by Erin Rachael Shellman. Thanks.)


ecell-3.2.0p1: 9-Feb-2010

 * Fixed the build system so that resource files for the GUI tools are
   correctly installed under the package data directory.

 * Fixed FileSelection combatibility wrapper so that they can present
   the text box for the filename entry.  Because of this bug, models could not
   be saved in session-monitor or model editor.

 * Made ecell3-dmc and dmcompile available on Windows.

 * Fixed a bug in System::detach() that causes random segfault on cleanup.

 * Fixed infinite recursion in ecell._ecs.Simulator.getDMSearchPath().


ecell-3.2.0: 5-Feb-2010

 * See the entries for 3.1.108.


ecell-3.2.0RC4: 3-Feb-2010

 * Fixed the release dates in NEWS file.

 * Removed System::dispose() that used to do the same clean-up process as
   System::detach() that is eventually called via EcsObject::dispose().
   This caused long-standing problem on Windows with MSVC.
 
 * Fixed typo in the MSVC build file for pyecell.


ecell-3.2.0RC3: 27-Jan-2010

 * Modified libecs::Stepper::log() so that it can be compiled with older
   version of Boost.

 * Added our version of std::bind2nd() to Utils.hpp for better compatibility.

 * For the rest of the changes, see the entries for 3.1.108RC3.


ecell-3.2.0RC2: 16-Jan-2010

 * See the entries for 3.1.108RC2


ecell-3.2.0RC1: 13-Jan-2009
 
 * A few cosmetic changes

   - Fixed indent / coding style.

   - Fixed doxygen comments.

   - Removed $...$ placeholders as they may contain localized characters
     which are troublesome in VC++.

 * dmtool changes

   - ModuleMaker class is removed and StaticModuleMaker<> template class is
     renamed to ModuleMaker<>.

   - Added SharedModuleMakerBase class that is the base class of
     SharedModuleMaker<> template classes.  Initialization and finalization
     static methods are moved from ModuleMaker to it.

   - SharedModuleMakerBase provides a couple of instance methods,
     setSearchPath() and getSearchPath() which sets or gets the path used when.
     looking up for a shared module.

   - Purged SharedDynamicModule and SharedModuleMaker into
     SharedDynamicModule.hpp and SharedModuleMaker.hpp respectively, in order
     to remove unwanted dependencies on libltdl.

 * libecs changes

   - Thoroughly overhauled DM/PropertiedClass ABI. Backwards binary
     compatibility was lost.

     - Added DynamicModuleDescriptor class that is defined per one dynamic
       module, and retains the information and a few set of fucntion pointers
       that are required to instantiate the module.

     - Added DynamicModuleInfo interface by which the meta-information
       regarding the dynamic module can be retrieved.

     - <AnyDMObject>::getClassInfo() now returns the PropertyInterface instead
       of synthesized Polymorph map.

     - PropertyInterface class is now a subclass of DynamicModuleInfo.

     - PropertyInterface objects are now initialized from within the associated
       ModuleMaker's rather than by the static initializers.

     - Removed PropertyInterface::getPropertyList().

     - Added PropertyInterface::getPropertyAttributes() that can be used in
       place of PropertyInterface::getInfoMap().

     - Renamed PropertySlotProxy to Accesor and ConcretePropertySlotProxy to
       PropertySlotAccessor. PropertyInterface::createPropertySlotProxy()
       is renamed to createAccessor() accordingly.

     - Changed the signature of EcsObject::defaultGetPropertyList() so that it
       returns a StringList by value, not by reference.

     - Added EcsObject::asString() that provides the description of
       the instance. 

     - Added EcsObject::dispose() that should be called when an EcsObject is
       no longer necessary but its destruction is not wanted.

     - Virtual function definitions are move from LIBECS_DM_OBJECT to
       LIBECS_DM_INIT_STATIC. This means the vtables and typeinfo entries for
       the base classes of a DM class are no longer instantiated within the
       compilation unit of that class, and this may lead to module load failure
       because of unresolved symbols unless you have explicity linked the
       resulting DM to the objects of the bases, or you have LIBECS_DM_INIT
       defined for the bases.

   - SystemPath::getString(), FullID::getString(), FullPN::getString() and
     EntityType::getString() are deprecated. Use SystemPath::asString(),
     FullID::asString(), FullPN::asString(), EntityType::asString() instead.

   - Made Process::setVariableReference() only accept VariableReference
     instead of scatterd arguments for consistency with getVariableReference().

   - ExpressionCompiler was moved from ecell/dm to ecell/libecs/scripting.

   - Added deleteStepper() and deleteEntity() to Model, which enables one
     to dynamically modify the structure of the model.

   - Added Model::setup() that needs to be called right after Model is
     constructed.  This was necessary to make the initialization process
     more customizable.

   - Entity:

     - Removed getFullIDString() from Entity.

     - Added asString() to Entity.

     - Added detach() to Entity, which allows one to detach an Entity
       (i.e. remove) from the Model.

   - Process:

     - Process::registerVariableReference() was changed to have the same
       signature as the previous version of Process::setVariableReference().

     - Processes now can accept multiple VariableReferences of the same name.
       They are differentiated with serial numbers.

     - The initialization process was splitted into two phases,
       Process::preinitialize() and Process::initialize(). preinitialize()
       are called to all the Processes before any other Entities are
       initialized through initialize(), and then initialize() are called
       as well as the other Entities.

   - System:

     - System's registerProcess(), registerVariable() and registerSystem() were
       renamed into a single overloaded function System::registerEntity(). 

     - Added unregisterEntity() to System.

   - Stepper:

     - Renamed Stepper's removeSystem() and removeProcess() to
       unregisterSystem() and unregisterProcess() respectively.

   - Logger:

     - Removed setAvg() / setMin() / setMax() from DataPoint.

     - Added Logger::Policy class and remove methods that accept polymorph
       tuples that contain the policy information.

     - Remove LoggerBroker::setModel() in favor of dependency injection in
       initialization.

   - DM search paths are now model specific. Remove setDMSearchPath() and
     getDMSearchpath() and introduce Model::setDMSearchPath() and
     Model::getDMSearchPath() respectively.

   - Polymorph

     - Polymorph got de-virtualated (TM) and refcounted for the sake of
       efficiency. Removed ConcretePolymorphValue and PolymorphNoneValue
       accordingly.

     - Polymorph was modified to accept boost::tuple<> and const char *.

     - enum Polymorph::Type was moved to PolymorphValue.

     - Neither PolymorphVector nor String is a containment type of Polymorph
       any longer due to introduction of Tuple and RawString types that are
       internally used in PolymorphValue.

     - Deprecated Polymorph::asTYPE().

   - Removed obsolute CompartmentSystem and FluxProcess.

 * libemc changes

   - Rename Simulator::isEntityExist() to Simulator::entityExists().

   - Remove Simulator::getLoggerMinimumInterval() and
     Simulator::setLoggerMinimumInterval() in favor of setLoggerPolicy().

 * pyecell changes

   - Added ecell._ecs.addPythonDM() that enables an user to implement one's own
     DMs in Python.

   - ecell._ecs.Simulator.getLoggerData() now returns
     ecell._ecs.DataPointSharedVector instead of
     numpy.core.multiarray.array(). The object can be safely fed to numpy
     functions as if it was of numpy arrays thanks to numpy's flexible array
     interface.  This enables zero-copy retrieval of logger data from libecs
     and significantly enhances the speed.

   - New classes:
     - ecell._ecs.Logger
     - ecell._ecs.LoggerPolicy
     - ecell._ecs.PropertyAttributes
     - ecell._ecs.AbstractSimulator

   - ecell._ecs.Simulator.setEventChecker() was removed as per the dismissal of
     the concept of event checker.  Instead, an event handler must return a
     boolean value that indicates if more events have to be handled.

   - ecell._ecs.Simulator.DMSearchPathSeparator was renamed to
     DM_SEARCH_PATH_SEPARATOR and changed to be a class property.

   - Added two class constants ELLIPSIS and ELLIPSIS_PREFIX to
     ecell._ecs.Simulator.


ecell-3.1.108: 5-Feb-2010

 * Added --disable-pyecell configure option to disable building python binding
   at all.  It will still need a python binary to compile DM's.

 * Fixed model-editor to not create temporary files under the current directory.
   This change solves permission-related problems on Windows and boosts up
   the start-up speed as well.


ecell-3.1.108RC3: 27-Jan-2010

 * Fixed dmcompile so that it would choose the right compiler.

 * Fixed libltdl autoconf script in order to get it work with newer versions
   of libtool.

 * libtool_overrides.m4 that overrides several internal functions of the
   libtool autoconf script to support Fujitsu C++ compiler.


ecell-3.1.108RC2: 15-Jan-2010

 * Fixed ecell3-dmc so that it accepts -o (--output=) option so that users
   can specify extra object files to the command line as well.

 * Resuscitate ecell3-session-monitor which stopped working due to the
   migration to gtk.Builder.


ecell-3.1.108RC1: 13-Jan-2010

 * Refactored differential steppers so that they give accurate results on
   the step right after the (re)start.  A new virtual method
   DifferentialStepper::updateInternalState() was added to accomplish this,
   and therefore backwards binary compatibility was lost as for Steppers' DMs.

 * Unbundled ply as it's pretty obsolete.  Users must install it beforehand.

 * Switched to gtk.Builder from gtk.glade.XML.


ecell-3.1.107: 4-Jul-2009

 * Added new API functions, libecs::issueWarning() and
   libecs::setWarningHandler() that can be used to report a warning to the
   frontend from within a dynamic module.

 * Deprecated Stepper's "MaxStepInterval" property as it doesn't make much
   sense.

 * Added a new property "TolerableRejectedStepCount" to DifferentialStepper
   (i.e. ODEStepper and its siblings) that specifies the maximum torelable
   count of rejected steps.

 * Fixed a bug in ODEStepper that causes SIGABRT under the circumstances
   no processes are associated to the stepper. Noticed by Sachio Nohara.
   Thanks.

 * Patched libltdl so it would not be interfered by the newer versions of
   libtool.

 * Migrated to libsbml 3.x.  SBML to EML and EML to SBML converter are now
   officially confirmed to work with it.

 * Changed ecell3-session-monitor so that it would never change the current
   working directory to the one the model file is located.
   Patch by Michele Mattioni.  Thanks.

 * Console class in the ecell3-session-manager script insensibly imports
   the attributes of a SessionManager instance into the global scope, which
   turned out to obstruct the definition of classes in the user script.
   Noticed by Giuseppe Aprea.  Thanks.


ecell-3.1.107RC4: 5-Apr-2009

 * Resource files required by the frontends (session monitor and model editor)
   were completely missing in the tarballs due to the errors in Makefile.
   Noticed by 김한조.  Thanks.

 * Console class in the ecell3-session-manager script insensibly imports
   the attributes of a SessionManager instance into the global scope, which
   turned out to obstruct the definition of classes in the user script.
   Noticed by Giuseppe Aprea.  Thanks.


ecell-3.1.107RC3: 11-Mar-2009

 * Remove deprecate API calls in session-monitor. This enables it to run
   on Mac OS X with the native GTK+.

 * Fixed bugs in DM compiler tools.

 * Fixed weird behavior of the expression compiler that is used in
   Expression*Process'es.

 * Eliminate usage of string module.

 * Fixed win32 build.


ecell-3.1.107RC2: 6-Feb-2009

 * Fixed a bug in ecell.Session.saveLoggerData().

 * Fixed a bug in ecell.ECDDataFile.


ecell-3.1.107RC1: 5-Feb-2009

 * Fixed compilation problem on newer GCC (>= 4.3).

 * Reorganized the source tree structure.

   - Integrated pyecs into pyecell.

   - Merged ecell.emc into ecell.ecs to avoid static initializer weirdness in
     some platform (including Mac OS X).

   - Two GUI frontends (session-monitor and model-editor) were renewed to be
     two packages of python modules, ecell.ui.osogo and ecell.ui.model_editor.

 * pyecell changes

   - Moved GtkSessionMonitor to ecell.ui.osogo.GtkSessionMonitor that resides
     in ecell/frontend/session_manager

   - Renamed ecell.SessionManager to ecell.session_manager.

   - Removed the following constants from ecell.ecs_constants.

     - TRUE
     - FALSE


ecell-3.1.106: 5-Feb-2008

  * class PropertySlotProxyLoggerAdapter was decoupled from PropertySlot.hpp
    to the separate file, PropertySlotProxyLoggerAdapter.hpp in order not to
    incorporate various concerns in a single file.

  * A number of leaks were plugged. Note that a few other leaks involved in
    property interfaces are still active in this release on purpose to
    maintain binary compatibility with older releases. The fix was already
    established and will be in the next release.

  * Visual Studio build files (build/msvc/*.vcproj) were updated so it can
    cross-build 64-bit binaries.

  * PythonProcess and PythonFluxProcess now don't require that python
    interpreter be already initialized.

  * model-editor no longer depends on Python for Windows Extension.
    Now the win32 / win64 native builds require Python 2.4 or later.


ecell-3.1.106RC2: 24-Dec-2007

  * Avoided resetting LD_LIBRARY_PATH in ecell-python for the sake of
    inter-platform operability. This was also problematic in combination within
    multiple ldconfig paths.

  * Fixed sample installation rule so that samples would get installed in
    sample-per-directory manner.

  * Fixed configure scripts for dmtool and dynamic modules so that modules they
    produce would have right extensions that follows the libltdl's convention.


ecell-3.1.106RC1: 14-Dec-2007

  * Updated bundled libtool script for better compatibility with MacOSX and
    similar systems.

  * The users manual is now bundled in the distribution.

  * Improved dynamic priority queue.

  * Support for the newest NumPy release in ecell.Analysis.

  * Numerous minor bugfixes.

  * Added two new functions, libecs::initialize() and libecs::finalize().
    Those functions need to be called before using the simulation kernel or
    after finished up with it respectively. Users don't have to take care of
    this change as long as they are using E-Cell through the Python frontends
    as these functions are automatically called on start-up and clean-up
    of pyecs module.
