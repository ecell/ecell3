ecell-3.2: ?-Nov-2008
 
 * A few cosmetic changes
   - Fixed indent / coding style.

   - Fixe doxygen comments.

   - Removed $...$ placeholders as they may contain localized characters
     which are troublesome in VC++.

 * Reorganized the source tree structure.

   - Integrated pyecs into pyecell.

   - Merged ecell.emc into ecell.ecs to avoid static initializer weirdness in
     some platform (including Mac OS X).

   - Two GUI frontends (session-monitor and model-editor) were renewed to be
     two packages of python modules, ecell.ui.osogo and ecell.ui.model_editor.

 * dmtool changes

   - ModuleMaker class is removed and StaticModuleMaker<> template class is
     renamed to ModuleMaker<>.

   - Added SharedModuleMakerBase class that is the base class of
     SharedModuleMaker<> template classes.  Initialization and finalization
     static methods are moved from ModuleMaker to it.

   - SharedModuleMakerBase provides a couple of instance methods,
     setSearchPath() and getSearchPath() which sets or gets the path used when.
     looking up for a shared module.

   - Purged SharedDynamicModule and SharedModuleMaker into
     SharedDynamicModule.hpp and SharedModuleMaker.hpp respectively, in order
     to remove unwanted dependencies on libltdl.

 * libecs changes

   - Thoroughly overhauled DM/PropertiedClass ABI. Backwards binary
     compatibility was lost.

     - Added DynamicModuleDescriptor class that is defined per one dynamic
       module, and retains the information and a few set of fucntion pointers
       that are required to instantiate the module.

     - Added DynamicModuleInfo interface by which the meta-information
       regarding the dynamic module can be retrieved.

     - <AnyDMObject>::getClassInfo() now returns the PropertyInterface instead
       of synthesized Polymorph map.

     - PropertyInterface class is now a subclass of DynamicModuleInfo.

     - PropertyInterface objects are now initialized from within the associated
       ModuleMaker's rather than by the static initializers.

     - Removed PropertyInterface::getPropertyList().

     - Added PropertyInterface::getPropertyAttributes() that can be used in
       place of PropertyInterface::getInfoMap().

     - Changed the signature of EcsObject::defaultGetPropertyList() so that it
       returns a StringList by value, not by reference.

     - Added the virtual EcsObject::asString() that provides the description of
       the instance. 

     - Virtual function definitions are move from LIBECS_DM_OBJECT to
       LIBECS_DM_INIT_STATIC. This means the vtables and typeinfo entries for
       the base classes of a DM class are no longer instantiated within the
       compilation unit of that class, and this may lead to module load failure
       because of unresolved symbols unless you have explicity linked the
       resulting DM to the objects of the bases, or you have LIBECS_DM_INIT
       defined for the bases.

   - SystemPath::getString(), FullID::getString(), FullPN::getString() and
     EntityType::getString() are deprecated. Use SystemPath::asString(),
     FullID::asString(), FullPN::asString(), EntityType::asString() instead.

   - Made Process::setVariableReference() only accept VariableReference
     instead of scatterd arguments for consistency with getVariableReference().

   - ExpressionCompiler was moved from ecell/dm to ecell/libecs/scripting.

   - Added deleteStepper() to Model.

   - Entiy:

     - Removed getFullIDString() from Entity.

     - Added asString() to Entity.

   - Procss:

     - Process::registerVariableReference() was changed to have the same
       signature as the previous version of Process::setVariableReference().

   - System:

     - System's registerProcess(), registerVariable() and registerSystem() were
       renamed into a single overloaded function System::registerEntity(). 

     - Added unregisterEntity() to System.

   - Stepper:

     - Renamed Stepper's removeSystem() and removeProcess() to
       unregisterSystem() and unregisterProcess() respectively.

   - Logger:

     - Removed setAvg() / setMin() / setMax() from DataPoint.

     - Added Logger::Policy class and remove methods that accept polymorph
       tuples that contain the policy information.

     - Remove LoggerBroker::setModel() in favor of dependency injection in
       initialization.

   - DM search paths are now model specific. Remove setDMSearchPath() and
     getDMSearchpath() and introduce Model::setDMSearchPath() and
     Model::getDMSearchPath() respectively.

   - Polymorph

     - Polymorph got de-virtualated (TM) and refcounted for the sake of
       efficiency. Removed ConcretePolymorphValue and PolymorphNoneValue
       accordingly.

     - Polymorph was modified to accept boost::tuple<> and const char *.

     - enum Polymorph::Type was moved to PolymorphValue.

     - Neither PolymorphVector nor String is a containment type of Polymorph
       any longer due to introduction of Tuple and RawString types that are
       internally used in PolymorphValue.

     - Deprecated Polymorph::asTYPE().

   - Removed obsolute CompartmentSystem and FluxProcess.

 * libemc changes.

   - Rename Simulator::isEntityExist() to Simulator::entityExists().

   - Remove Simulator::getLoggerMinimumInterval() and

   - Simulator::setLoggerMinimumInterval() in favor of setLoggerPolicy().


 * pyecell changes

   - Moved GtkSessionMonitor to ecell.ui.osogo.GtkSessionMonitor that resides
     in ecell/frontend/session_manager

   - Renamed ecell.SessionManager to ecell.session_manager.

   - Removed the following constants from ecell.ecs_constants.

     - TRUE
     - FALSE

   - ecell._ecs.Simulator.getLoggerData() now returns
     ecell._ecs.DataPointSharedVector instead of
     numpy.core.multiarray.array(). The object can be safely fed to numpy
     functions as if it was of numpy arrays thanks to numpy's flexible array
     interface.  This enables zero-copy retrieval of logger data from libecs
     and significantly enhances the speed.

   - New classes:
     - ecell._ecs.Logger
     - ecell._ecs.LoggerPolicy
     - ecell._ecs.PropertyAttributes

   - ecell._ecs.Simulator.setEventChecker() is removed as per the dismissal of
     the concept of event checker.  Instead, an event handler must return a
     boolean value that indicates if more events have to be handled.
