=== About ===

This is a model for the glycolysis of human erythrocytes which takes
into account ATP-synthesis and -consumption.
This model is based on the model introduced in the following publication.

Rapoport, T.A. and Heinrich, R. (1975)
"Mathematical analysis of multienzyme systems. I. Modelling of the glycolysis of human erythrocytes.",
Biosystems., 7, 1, 120-129.

=== Running this model ===

1. (If necessary) Convert the .em file to .eml file.

   % ecell3-em2eml Heinrich.em
   % ls Heinrich.eml
   Heinrich.eml

2. Run ecell3-session-monitor, File->loadModel and load the Heinrich.eml file.

3. Run MCA.py file and see results.
