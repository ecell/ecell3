=== About ===

This is a very simple sample model, 
intended to introduce E-Cell 3 to beginners.
This model consists of only three molecular species(S, P, E),
and one reaction(MichaelisUniUniProcess).



=== Files and directories ===

README:                     This file
simple.em:                  Model file(em file) for this model
MichaelisUniUniProcess.cpp: Process file(cpp file) for this model 
			    this file in standard-Process


=== Running this model ===

1. (If necessary) Convert the .em file to .eml file.

   % ecell3-em2eml simple.em
   % ls simple.eml
   simple.eml


2. Compile .cpp files, but does not need this section.

3. Run the model.

   GUI mode:
       gecell, File->loadModel and load the simple.eml file.

   Script mode:
