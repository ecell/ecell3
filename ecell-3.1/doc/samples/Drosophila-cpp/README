=== About ===

This is a model of the oscillating Drosophila period protein(PER),
to be run on E-Cell Simulation Environment Version 3.
This model is based on the model introduced in the following publication.

A.Goldbeter, 
"A model for circadian oscillations in the Drosophila period protein(PER)"
Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci, Vol.261:319-324, Sep 1995.

README:      This file
Drosophila.em:  Model file(em file) for this model
*.cpp:        Process files(dm files) for this model


=== Running this model ===

1. (If necessary) Convert the .em file to .eml file.

   % ecell3-em2eml Drosophila.em
   % ls Drosophila.eml
   Drosophila.eml


2. Compile .cpp files.

   Run ecell3-dmc for each .cpp file.

   % ecell3-dmc ...cpp

   Or, to do this job at once,

   (at bash prompt,)
   % for i in *.cpp ; do ecell3-dmc $i ; done
   

3. Run gecell, File->loadModel and load the Drosophila.eml file.
