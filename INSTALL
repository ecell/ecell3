Getting the latest version of E-Cell 3
======================================

1. Get tarball:

   Official distributions can be found at:

     http://www.e-cell.org/software

2. Get source code via Subversion:

   Official development site of E-Cell 3 is:

     http://www.e-cell.org/software

   You can get the latest development version through anonymous repository
   access.  See the instruction in the following page:

     http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=72485

   The repository of the E-Cell 3.1 series is located in:

     http://ecell.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ecell/ecell3/branches/ecell-3.1

   The breeding edge version (head revision) of E-Cell can be fetched from
   the following:

     http://ecell.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ecell/ecell3/trunk

   Note that the head is less likely to work in your environment since
   it is always under heavy development.

with a separate build system that resides in build/msvc.
