Getting the latest version of E-Cell 3
======================================

1. Get a tarball:

   Official distributions can be found at:

     http://www.e-cell.org/software

2. Or, get the latest source code via Subversion:

   Official development site of E-Cell 3 is:

     http://www.e-cell.org/software

   You can get the latest development version through anonymous repository
   access.  See the instruction in the following page:

     http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=72485

   The repository of the E-Cell 3.1 series is located in:

     http://ecell.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ecell/ecell3/branches/ecell-3.1

   The breeding edge version (head revision) of E-Cell can be fetched from
   the following:

     http://ecell.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ecell/ecell3/trunk

   Note that the head is less likely to work in your environment since
   it is always under heavy development.


Supported Systems
=================

Will work in most modern Unix-like systems. Windows build is now supported
with a separate build system that resides under build/msvc.


Building Prerequisite
=====================

1. GNU compiler collections (version 3.1 or later)

  http://gcc.gnu.org/

2. Python version 2.3 or later

  http://www.python.org/

3. Boost C++ libraries (version 1.33.0 or later)

  http://www.boost.org/

4. GNU scientific library (GSL) (version 1.8 or later)

  http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

5. NumPy (version 1.0 or later, >= 1.0.3 is recommended)

  http://numpy.scipy.org/

6. (optional) PyGTK (version 2.0 or later, >= 2.6 is recommended)
   -- only needed to build GUI frontends. 

  http://www.pygtk.org/

  Notes:

  * Glade support is also needed to get the frontend to work, so
    libglade of a version that satisifies the PyGTK requisuite
    has to be installed beforehand.

  * if you wish to use E-Cell on a headless environment, specify
    ``--disable-gui`` option to configure script.  Otherwise
    configure will fail with an error in the check of PyGTK installation.

7. (optional) GNOME-Python (version 2.0 or later, >= 2.6 is recommended)
   -- only needed to build GUI frontends. 

  http://www.pygtk.org/

8. (optional) libsbml (version 2.x) -- needed for SBML support.

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml

  At the time of writing the latest version of the 2.x series is 2.3.5.

  libsbml 3.x series are not supported due to significant API differences.

9. (optional) doxygen -- neeeded to generate API reference

  http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/

  The documentation is currently incomplete.

10. (optional) docbook-tools -- needed to generate users manual

  http://sources.redhat.com/docbook-tools/

  In debian and its derivatives, it is provided as docbook-utils package.

Install
=======

1. ./configure [--prefix=...] [--...]
2. make
3. make install

  NOTE:
  you need to run ./autogen.sh before running configure in case you have
  obtained the source from the repository.

You may find the following configure options are useful.

  ``--with-boost-python-libname=LIBNAME``
     Specify the library name (the portion of the file name with
     the `lib` prefix and the extension removed) of the Boost.Python,
     which falls back to `boost_python`.
 
  ``--disable-gui``
     Specify this when you do not want GUI frontend.
