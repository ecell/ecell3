=== About ===

This is a numerical example model using tau-leap method[1,2].

Tau-leap Method is to accelerate the exact stochastic simulation algorithm 
by using a specail Poisson approximation to leap over sequences of non-critical
reaction events. 

This model consists of three molecular species(S1, S2, S3),
and four reaction(TauLeapProcess).

The schema of this model is here:

 S1->0, S1+S1<=>S2, S2->S3

In these reactions, a decey-prone monomer S1 reversibly dimerizes 
to an unstable form S2,which can convert to a stable form S3.
