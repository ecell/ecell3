    <para>If you are just to start using &app; Version 3 as a
     <emphasis>user</emphasis>, read chapters 2, 3, and try it in your
     project.  Read the rest parts if you feel it is necessary.
     Especially you may want to browse chapter 6 to know what classes
     are available to create your model.  If you cannot find what you
     need in that chapter, you may want to develop your own module by
     reading chapter 5.  Reading chapter 4 will help you to automate
     your simulation runs.  If you are a <emphasis>frontend module
     developer</emphasis> of &app; written in &Python;, read mainly
     chapter 4.  You may also want to read chapters 2 and 3 if you are
     not already familiar with how the system is organized and used.
     If you are a C++ <emphasis>Dynamic Module developer</emphasis>, (for
     example, to create a new algorithm module) you need to
     read at least the chapter 5.  Read chapters 2 and 3 if you are not already
     familiar with &ecell;.  Also, you may want to read the chapter 6
     to know how existing classes are designed.</para>
