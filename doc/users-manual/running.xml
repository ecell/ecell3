  <!-- =========== Getting Started ============================== -->
  <!-- Use the Getting Started section to describe the steps required
  to start the application and to describe the user interface components
  of the application. If there is other information that it is important
  for readers to know before they start using the application, you should
  also include this information here. 
  If the information about how to get started is very short, you can 
  include it in the Introduction and omit this section. -->

              Linux operating system), if you are using special classes
              of object in the model file which is not provided by the system
              by default.

      <title>Converting EM to EML</title>

      <para>Simulation models for &ecell; is often written in &EM; format.
        To convert &EM; (.em) files to &EML; (.eml) files, type the
        following command.
      </para>
      <para><command>ecell3-em2eml</command> <replaceable>filename.em</replaceable></para>
      <para>You can obtain the full description of the command line options
      giving -h option to <command>ecell3-em2eml</command>.</para>
      <para>
      <screen>ecell3-eml2em -- convert eml to em
         
Usage:
        ecell3-eml2em [-h] [-f] [-o outfile] infile
 
         
Options:
        -h or --help    :  Print this message.
        -f or --force   :  Force overwrite even if outfile already exists.
        -o or --outfile=:  Specify output file name.  '-' means stdout.

      <title>Compiling C++ Dynamic Modules</title>

      <para>
        You might have some Dynamic Modules (or &DM; in short)
        specifically made for the simulation model in the form of C++
        source code.  If that is the case, those files have to be compiled
        and linked to form shared module files (usually suffixed by
        <literal>.so</literal> on Unix-like platforms, <literal>.dylib</literal>
        on Mac OS X or <literal>.dll</literal> on Windows) before running the
        simulation.  You will also need to set
        <literal>ECELL3_DM_PATH</literal> environment variable to the
        appropriate value to use the &DM;s (discussed below).
      </para>

      <para>
        To compile and like &DM;s,  <command>ecell3-dmc</command> command is provided for convenience.
      </para>

      <screen><command>ecell3-dmc</command> <option>[options]</option>
<replaceable>filename.cpp</replaceable> <option>[compiler options]</option></screen>

      <para>The arguments given before the file name (<option>[command
      options]</option> are interpreted as options to the
      <command>ecell3-dmc</command> command itself.</para>

      <para>The arguments after the file name are passed to a backend
      compiler (such as g++) as-is.  The backend compiler used is the
      same as that used to build the system itself.</para>

      <para>To inspect what the command actually does inside, enable
      verbose mode by specifying <option>-v</option> option.</para>

      <para>To get a full list of available
      <command>ecell3-dmc</command> options, invoke the command with
      <option>-h</option> option, and without the input file.  Here is
the help message shown by issuing <command>ecedll3-dmc</command> <option>-h</option>.

<literallayout class="monospaced">
Compile dynamic modules for E-Cell Simulation Environment Versin 3.

Usage:
        ecell3-dmc [ ecell3-dmc options ] sourcefile [ compiler options ]
        ecell3-dmc -h|--help

ecell3-dmc options:
        --no-stdinclude          Don't set standard include file path.
        --no-stdlibdir           Don't set standard include file path.
        --ldflags=[ldflags]      Specify options to the linker.
        --cxxflags=[cxxflags]    Override the default compiler options.
        --dmcompile=[path]       Specify dmcompile path.
        -v or --verbose          Be verbose.

      <title>DM search path and <literal>ECELL3_DM_PATH</literal> environment variable</title>

      <para>
        If your model makes use of non-standard &DM;s that you had to build
        using <command>ecell3-dmc</command>, then you need to specify
        the directory where the &DM;s are placed in
        <literal>ECELL3_DM_PATH</literal> environment variable.
        <literal>ECELL3_DM_PATH</literal> can have multiple directory names
        separated by either <literal>:</literal> (colon) on Unix-like platform
        or <literal>;</literal> (semicolon) on Windows.
      </para>
      <para>
        The following is an example of setting <literal>ECELL3_DM_PATH</literal> before launching <command>ecell3-session-monitor</command>:

      <para>
        Note that up to E-Cell SE 3.1.105, the current working directory was
        implicitly treated as if it was included in
        <literal>ECELL3_DM_PATH</literal>.
        This quirk is removed since 3.1.106.
