phenomena.

Organization of This Manual
------------------------------

This manual has the following chapters.

1. Introduction -- you are here

2. Getting Started

3. Modeling with E-Cell

4. Scripting E-Cell

5. Creating New Object Classes

6. Standard Dynamic Module Library

If you are just to start using APP Version 3 as a *user*, read chapters
2, 3, and try it in your project. Read the rest parts if you feel it is
necessary. Especially you may want to browse chapter 6 to know what
classes are available to create your model. If you cannot find what you
need in that chapter, you may want to develop your own module by reading
chapter 5. Reading chapter 4 will help you to automate your simulation
runs. If you are a *frontend module developer* of APP written in PYTHON,
read mainly chapter 4. You may also want to read chapters 2 and 3 if you
are not already familiar with how the system is organized and used. If
you are a C++ *Dynamic Module developer*, (for example, to create a new
algorithm module) you need to read at least the chapter 5. Read chapters
2 and 3 if you are not already familiar with ECELL. Also, you may want
to read the chapter 6 to know how existing classes are designed.
