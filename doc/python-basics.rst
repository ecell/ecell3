Python Basics for E-Cell Users
==============================

In Python, setting values of variables is a very simple job as in most
other languages. For example, to set a string to a variable, use single
quotes: CLASSNAME = 'NuclearFusionProcess'

Numbers doesn't need the quotation: FOOVAR = 3.11

To set a multiple line string, use triple quotes: DESCRIPTION = ''' some
multi-line description. '''
